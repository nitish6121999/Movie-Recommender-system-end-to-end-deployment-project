## **Project Summary** : Building a Movie Recommender System using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

## **Introduction**
The aim of this project is to create a movie recommender system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The dataset contains information about thousands of movies, including their titles, genres, plot summaries, and user ratings. By leveraging this dataset, we will develop a recommender system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and movie attributes.

Conclusion:
In this project, we leveraged the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to develop a movie recommender system. We performed data loading, preprocessing, including lower casing and text normalization, and text vectorization to convert textual features into numerical representations. Finally, built the recommender system using content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and movie attributes.
